# PalindromeCheckerAppManagementSystem



## 📌 Objective
The objective of the **PalindromeChecker App** is to design and implement a
**console-based Java application** that validates whether a given string is a
palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening **core programming
fundamentals** and **data structure concepts**.

## 🚀 Use Case 1 (UC1): Application Entry & Welcome Message

### 🎯 Goal
Display a welcome message and application details at startup.

### 👤 Actor
User

### 🔄 Flow
1. Program starts.
2. JVM invokes the `main()` method.
3. Application name is displayed.
4. Application version is displayed.
5. Program continues to the next use case or exits.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used in UC1

- **Class**  
  Acts as a container for the Palindrome Checker application logic.

- **Main Method**  
  Entry point of the Java application with the signature:  
  `public static void main(String[] args)`

- **Static Keyword**  
  Allows the JVM to invoke the `main()` method without creating an object.

- **Console Output**  
  `System.out.println()` is used to display messages on the console.

- **Application Flow Control**  
  Defines the startup behavior before palindrome processing begins.

## ▶️ How to Run the Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the program: javac PalindromeCheckerApp.java
4. Run the program: java PalindromeCheckerApp
